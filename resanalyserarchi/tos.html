		The presented data is by far, accurate.
        If you find any discrepancies please report the same.
        I can NOT be held responsible for any flaws or errors or any other as such discrepancies!<br/>
        You may use the result analysis in whatever way you find useful (I urge you to respect other's privacy though).
        The data utilized is publicly available & best possible measures are taken by me to preserve the privacy of everyone, atleast much more than what the college does. I have restrained myself from publishing data that shows competitive comparisons.<br/>
        If you still have any what-so-ever objections, please report them to
